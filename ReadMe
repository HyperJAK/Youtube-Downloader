Steps to take to make app:
- List of all features: -Download videos
- Download Audios
- Choose audio quality and video quality
- Open a folder that contains files and play them
- Save the folder paths so that on app relaunch i see them in app ready to play
- Show option to download all playlist if a video link has list=somerandomnumbers in it
- Give user option to change api key from settings
- Make app dark mode option 
- Add error messages that popup based on the try catch error so that the user knows exectly what is the problem
- Add the ability to check video if its in a playlist or not and based on that as kuser if he wants to download video only or all playlist
-Display video length and quality and size before downloading and ofc as kuser to confirm the start of the download
- To download playlists we just need to use the other python package to check for playlist id of the vid and then get id's of all vids in the playlist and then append the id's to https://youtu.be/(id goes here) and then download them all
- Add with every downloaded video or audio its thumbnail and name and other info in a new folder so then i can use it in the video player as a background
